# Advent-of-code-24
Advent of code 2024, solutions, development, and working code.

For this year, all of the solutions developed in Python have been populated in a Jupyter notebook (`Advent_of_code_24.ipynb`).

In addition, some of the solutions have been developed in Rust, to compare the performance against those developed in Python.
